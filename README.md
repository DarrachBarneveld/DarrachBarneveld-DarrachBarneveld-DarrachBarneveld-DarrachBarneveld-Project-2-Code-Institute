## Design

### Design Choices

The initial design phase went through two stages. The initial inception of the trivia game was to be centred around Australia. The game was to have users answer questions about Australian wildlife and conquer the respective territories of Australia on an interactive map. You would collect Trump cards with information about the different states. This initial design choice can be seen in the final product. The design was also heavily inspired by trivia crack a mobile game as well as trivial pursuit. Players collect colourful segments and trump cards to conquer the wheel. Instead of states it is now category trump cards.

Some websites visited for reference are:

1. [Trivia Crack](https://triviacrack.com/)
2. [Australia Guide](https://www.australias.guide/qld/maps/)

### Colours

The Colour Scheme was based off the initial Trivia Crack game. [Trivia Crack](https://triviacrack.com/)

Main Colours - #3771b4 / #de3539 / #f4b335 / #6ec531 / #e36927 / #803788 / #66b9de / #ff69b4;

Theme Colours - #533b7c / #f4e8df

All colours were checked using [Accessible Webs Contrast Checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/). This ensured the page was compliant to WCAG AAA standards.

![Theme](documentation/theme-colour-scheme.webp)

### Fonts

All fonts used were sourced and imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library.

All font used is Ubuntu with a sans-serif fallback.

### Structure

The main structure was designed with the mobile first development mindset in mind.

The site structure was inspired by reactive sites built with JS frameworks. I wanted a dynamic SPA feel to the user experience. The main page is a simple map/wheel with a scoreboard listing categories. I wanted users to interact with the elements on the page and choose segments to select categories. There is a simple header for navgation, main contents, and a footer. The game screen is dynamically generated depending on search parameters and the questions are shown 1 by 1.

### Index

1. Header/Navigation
2. Main Section / Wheel + Scoreboard
3. Footer

### Game

1. Header/Navigation
2. Main Section / Dynamic Questions. Inspired by the React Framework.
3. Footer

### Trophies

1. Header/Navigation
2. Main Section / Grid Trump card layout
3. Footer

There were also two further supplementary sections to provide a more well rounded experience. A 404 page was designed to route all traffic back to the home page if they visited an unknown url.

#### Header Section

1. Text Logo featured on the left of the header.
2. Navigation items to the left hand side.

#### Index Section

1. Large Map/Wheel interactive image featuring category segements. Located on the left
2. Scoreboard listing categories and medal count for each. Located on the right

#### Game Section

##### Pre-game

2. Medal count
3. Form for difficulty selection
4. Start quiz and home navigation buttons

##### During-game

### Testing user stories

#### Website/Business Owner

- I want to test the site's usability and navigation, to ensure that users can easily find the information they need and navigate between pages.

  1. Users can navigate to any page by using the header navigation.
  1. Users can navigate to any trivia section by either selecting the wheel segment or clicking on the category name.

- I want to test the site's performance and loading speed, to ensure that it can handle a high volume of traffic and provide a smooth user experience.

  1. Site passing all performance testing metrics.

  1. Site is fully responsive across all platforms.
  2. Site is usable across all different browsers.
  3. Site passes all testing for accessibility.

  1. Working contact email as well as direct linking to social platforms located on footer of each page.
  2. Clearly legiable name with trade marked website located on footer

- I want to make sure users are directed back to the index page of the website and not rely on the browser navigation to return to the home page.
  1. 404 page instructs the user the page doesn't exist and directs them back to the home page with a navigation button on the both header and below 404 text.

#### New Users:

- I want to immediately understand the content of the site so I can make a quick decision as to whether or not to continue.

  1. Clean UI with large image of wheel to show the context of the trivia game website (similar to trivial pursuit).
  2. Clear categories so users can see what they are answering questions on.

- I want to be able to quickly navigate to desired areas of the website and find the information displayed clearly and concisely.

  1. Heading navigation on each page.
  2. Clean and presentable UI that makes the questions easy to answer and read.
  3. Images for each category that are relatable.
  4. Trump cards and medals to show users progress

#### Existing Users:

- I want them to be able to check the current progression by tracking medals and trophy cards.

  1. Medals for each category difficulty mode completed
  2. Success page is routed to upon completion of the form giving user feedback.

- I want the questions to be unique and randomly generated.
  1. Use of Open Trivia API guarentees the quality of the questions.
