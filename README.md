## Design

### Design Choices

The initial design phase went through two stages. The initial inception of the trivia game was to be centred around Australia. The game was to have users answer questions about Australian wildlife and conquer the respective territories of Australia on an interactive map. You would collect Trump cards with information about the different states. This initial design choice can be seen in the final product. The design was also heavily inspired by trivia crack a mobile game as well as trivial pursuit. Players collect colourful segments and trump cards to conquer the wheel. Instead of states it is now category trump cards.

Some websites visited for reference are:

1. [Trivia Crack](https://triviacrack.com/)
2. [Australia Guide](https://www.australias.guide/qld/maps/)

### Colours

The Colour Scheme was based off the initial Trivia Crack game. [Trivia Crack](https://triviacrack.com/)

Main Colours - #3771b4 / #de3539 / #f4b335 / #6ec531 / #e36927 / #803788 / #66b9de / #ff69b4;

Theme Colours - #533b7c / #f4e8df

All colours were checked using [Accessible Webs Contrast Checker](https://accessibleweb.com/color-contrast-checker/). This ensured the page was compliant to WCAG AAA standards.

![Main](documentation/main-colour-scheme.webp)
![Theme](documentation/theme-colour-scheme.webp)

### Fonts

All fonts used were sourced and imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) library.

All font used is Ubuntu with a sans-serif fallback.

### Structure

The main structure was designed with the mobile first development mindset in mind.

The site structure was inspired by reactive sites built with JS frameworks. I wanted a dynamic SPA feel to the user experience. The main page is a simple map/wheel with a scoreboard listing categories. I wanted users to interact with the elements on the page and choose segments to select categories. There is a simple header for navgation, main contents, and a footer. The game screen is dynamically generated depending on search parameters and the questions are shown 1 by 1.

### Index

1. Header/Navigation
2. Main Section / Wheel + Scoreboard
3. Footer

### Game

1. Header/Navigation
2. Main Section / Dynamic Questions. Inspired by the React Framework.
3. Footer

### Trophies

1. Header/Navigation
2. Main Section / Grid Trump card layout
3. Footer

There were also two further supplementary sections to provide a more well rounded experience. A 404 page was designed to route all traffic back to the home page if they visited an unknown url.

#### Header Section

1. Text Logo featured on the left of the header.
2. Navigation items to the left hand side.

#### Index Section

1. Large Map/Wheel interactive image featuring category segements. Located on the left
2. Scoreboard listing categories and medal count for each. Located on the right

#### Game Section

##### Pre-game

1. Category Logo image
2. Medal count
3. Form for difficulty selection
4. Start quiz and home navigation buttons

##### During-game

1. Category Logo image
2. Score and Question Count
3. Question
4. Answer buttons

#### Footer Section

1. Social Icons
2. Contact Information of the developer
3. Copywrite claims

| MAJOR BUG: COMMIT ISSUES - building this project was done using local VSCODE and the Live server extension. Files were then transfered to Gitpod to be pushed to repo. This was to avoid going over 50 hours. Difficulties pushing from local VS-Code meant this approach was used. | Bug not fixed. Unknown why all commits were not tracked. From the main screen commits are recorded but not listed on project repo commit total. Perhaps this was due to transfering files from local VS-Code to gitpod for commiting and pushing to repo. |
| Due to the hero image animation using CSS background url the image was unable to be optimised. This leads to high load times and poor performance.                                                                                                                                  | Using CSS media queries the hero image was disabled on mobile devices leading to better performance and lighthouse scores.                                                                                                                                |
| Embedding youtube videos and lead to large delays in performance. Reduce unused JavaScript, Javascript execution times and serving static assets were issues.                                                                                                                       | Following the tutorial on [Vumbnail](https://vumbnail.com/examples/srcdoc-iframe-for-lighthouse) I was able to drastically reduce performance issues by following the instructional srcdoc html setup.                                                    |
| Embedding Google Maps meant the certain errors were not able to be resolved. These were serving static assets with an efficient cache policy.                                                                                                                                       | Unfortunately no reasonable solution was found and this is a common error when embedding google maps. Without use of custom Javascript code which is beyond the scope of this project.                                                                    |
